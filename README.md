# data-structures-and-algorithms
Practice data structures and algorithm problems. 

Each file has examples and explanations of various data structures and algorithms. Some are unfinished, just done for my own practice, some can be used to see things like how to create a particular data structure and implement it in different ways in JavaScript.
